# Info Bot - RAG Based AI Assistant for the College Website

Welcome to this official repository, This is designed to help users navigate and understand the resources, rules, and offerings of a college website. Whether you're a prospective student or a current one, this chatbot ensures that you get the right answers — fast and accurately.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   Web crawling and PDF processing are used to gather data from the college's digital resources (e.g., rules,     syllabus PDFs, notices, FAQs).

2. **Text Chunking & Embedding**  
   Extracted content is chunked using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, and each chunk is embedded using **Google Gemini’s `embeddings-001` model**.

3. **Vector Store**  
   These embeddings are stored in a local **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index for lightning-fast similarity searches.

4. **Question Answering**  
   When a user asks a question, the chatbot:
   - Performs a similarity search on the vector store.
   - Sends the most relevant chunks to **Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-pro`)**.
   - Returns an accurate, context-aware response.
